This repository demonstrates the use of worker threads in a Node.js application to handle CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main thread. It features an Express.js server that serves two endpoints: a non-blocking operation and a CPU-intensive operation managed by worker threads.


## Features

- **Non-Blocking I/O**: Demonstrates a simple, non-blocking request.
- **Multithreading**: Uses Node.js worker threads to handle heavy computation.
- **Scalable**: Example of how to split a task across multiple threads.
